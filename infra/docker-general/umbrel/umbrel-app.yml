  Connect with your neighbors, share tools, help each other, and build community trust

  • Neighbor Profiles - Know who lives nearby
  
  • Web of Trust - Vouch for trusted neighbors
  
  • Community Feed - Share updates and announcements
  
  • Tool Shed - Borrow and lend tools (Library of Things)
  
  • Helping Hands - Request and offer mutual aid
  
  • Ephemeral Chat - Private, disappearing messages
  
  
  Your neighborhood data stays in your neighborhood. No central servers,
  no data harvesting, no algorithms - just community.
